# Simple Web Server in Rust

A lightweight web server implemented in Rust, designed to serve static HTML content and handle basic HTTP requests. This server demonstrates the capabilities of Rust for network programming and is suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex web applications.

## Features

- Serves HTML files from the local file system.
- Handles basic GET requests, including a sleep route to demonstrate delayed responses.
- Returns a 404 error page for unrecognized routes.

## Prerequisites

- Rust programming language installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions on [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Cargo, the Rust package manager, which comes with the Rust installation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
